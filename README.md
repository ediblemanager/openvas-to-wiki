openvas-to-wiki - Linux Only - Beta!
===============

Process openVAS HTML output to mediawiki format.

This collection of scripts (mostly ruby, but with elements of bash and perl) takes the output from openVAS and processes the results into a MediaWiki format, ready for upload.

This script requires html2wiki (with mediawiki plugin) to function.

I've run this script, mostly unedited on both Fedora (F16,17) and Ubuntu (10.04, 11.10) machines.
